1. a link to an article or web site you find interesting related to software development/engineering (indirect relationships are ok)
    https://www.codemag.com/article/1304011

2. a paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article
    As a Film and TV and Computer Science double major, I am constantly struggling between the balance between these two subjects because how different they seems to be. This article is especially interesting to me because it describes the parallels between software development and filmaking process. This different phases of a sprint as we talked in class is very similar to the process of filmmaking which includes the pre-produciton, production, and post-production. This article made me realized that my extensive filmmaking experiences are also useful for me as an software engineer who needs to frequently collaborate and communicate with teammates. It helps me find a piece of mind for myself how interconnected these two hobbies of mine are.
